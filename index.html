            <h4>What is the Problem?</h4>

            <p>
                The problem that I am approaching is a battle racing AI for my team project.<br />
                This AI will need to be able to find it's own way round the track and interact with the
                players via steering the car and using the weapons and powerups around the map
            </p>

            <h4>Why does the problem need solving?</h4>

            <p>
                The problem needs solving because the game is local multiplayer.
                If you are trying to play the game on your own then it would be very dull to play.
                There will need to be AI in the game to keep it interesting for the player and the
                AI will need to behave in a way that is similar to that of a real player to make it feel
                like a challenge

        <h4>Which Technique to use:</h4>

        <p>
            The techniques I had considered using were GOAP and a more simple Utility based AI.<br />
            While learning about different AI techniques, these stood out to me because they did not seem
            too difficult to implement and they could provide the functionality that I was looking for.
            I could create an AI that would have a set of goals that it needed to complete and would react to the
            situation it was in and respond by picking actions to carry out.

            <h4>GOAP:</h4>

            <p>
                GOAP, which stands for Goal Oriented Action Planning, while still being a Utility based system, builds on it significantly<br />
                Using the GOAP system, each agent will have a set of actions that they can carry out
                and a set of goals that it tries to complete. <br />
                Here I have a diagram that shows 2 goals: Combat and Race. These goals consist of the
                actions that it takes to complete them.<br />The combat goal consists of the "Get Weapon",
                "Find Nearest Player" and "Shoot Player" actions. The goal is complete when a player is shot.
                <br />The Race goal consists of the "Find Next Race Point" and "Drive To Next Point" actions. The
                goal is complete when the car has driven to the point.<br />
                The agent would have a set of biases for these goals as to which goal it tries to complete.
                Each action will also have a cost to complete, this allows the agent to work out what it should do.
                If the agent had no biases then it would do the same thing every time when given
                the same circumstances. The biases allow for variance.

            <h4>Utility</h4>

            <p>
                Utility based AI is a system that uses cost analysis to pick the most efficient actions to take.<br />
                The diagram to the right shows a scenario where an agent is running out of food and needs more.
                They can either go to the shops and buy the food or they can order the food online.
                <h5>Going to get food:<br /></h5>
                If the agent goes to get food themself then the costs they will encounter are: &#0163 1.50 fuel there and back and
                &#0163 50 for food. <br />The total cost for this is:
                (1.5 x 2) + 50 = 53.<br />
                <h5>Ordering online:<br /></h5>
                If the agent decides to order online then the costs are: &#0163 50 for food and the &#0163 2 delivery fee.<br />
                The total cost for ordering online is:
                50 + 2 = 52.<br />
                <br />
                The more efficient action in this instance is to order the food online since the petrol costs outweigh the delivery costs.
                However, if the agent is in dire need of food then they might not be able to wait for the food. if we add the 72 hour delivery
                time to the cost for ordering online, the cost is increased to 52 + 72 = 124. This would make going to get the food the more efficient action.<br /><br />
                <h5>Biases<br /></h5>
                Biases can be added to the agents calculations. If we add a bias to the agent to have a strong preferance against travel then we can change the calculation.
                If we cost travel at &#0163 30/hour and the trip would take 1.5 hours each way then the calculation becomes:<br />
                (1.5 x 2) + 50 + (1.5hr x 2 x 30) = 143.<br />
                After adding the bias, the more efficient action becomes ordering online again.

            <h4>My Solution</h4>

            <p>
                For my solution I decided to use a utility based system with different agents using the same system but with different biases to create variance in the choices that they make and therefore creating
                more interesting agents that will be more entertaining to play against. I think this was the right choice to make because I think it is achievable in the time frame and it is going to give the complexity that
                I am looking for without increasing my workload too much. I would definitely like to look into GOAP more and create a system that uses it because it is a very interesting
                concept and would be a challenge to implement.
