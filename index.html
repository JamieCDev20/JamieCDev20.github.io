        <h4>What is the Problem?</h4>
        <p>
        The problem that I am approaching is a battle racing AI for my team project.<br />
        This AI will need to be able to find it's own way round teh track and interact with the 
        players via steering the physics based car controller and using the weapons and powerups 
        around the map

        <h4>Why does the problem need solving?</h4>
        <p>
            The problem needs solving because the game is local multiplayer. 
        If you are trying to play the game on your own then it would be very dull to play. 
        There will need to be AI in the game to keep it interesting for the player. 
        The AI will need to behave in a way that is similar to that of a real player to make it feel 
        like a challenge

    <h4>Which Technique to use:</h4>
    <p>
        The techniques i had considered using were GOAP and a more simple Utility based AI.<br />
        While learning about different AI techniques, these stood out to me because they did not seem 
        too difficult to implement and they could provide the functionality that i was looking for.
        I could create an AI that would have a set of things that it could do and would react to the 
        situation it was in and respond by picking actions to carry out.
