        Karts and Krafts<br />
        A couch play kart racing game where you decide how you win.<br />
        Either win the race fair and square by out-driving your competition and using<br />
        powerups to your advantage<br />
        or<br />
        Annihilate your competition with various weapons to be the last kart driving!
        <br />

        <br />
        In Karts and Krafts I was the only programmer on the team so all of the code<br />
        in the game was written by me.<br />
        The project was developed for about 6 months over my 2nd year at university.<br /><br />
        
        Most of my time on the project was spent on the racing AI which utilises a simple<br />
        Utility function to create different behaviours so that some of the AI will <br />
        try to collect weapons to attack the players, some will try to collect powerups<br />
        to get ahead and some will just try to race as fast as possible.
