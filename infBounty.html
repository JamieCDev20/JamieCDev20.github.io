        Infinite Bounty is the project I am currently developing with my team for our<br />
        3rd year at university. I was one of two programmers on this project.<br />
        I Developed most of the front end systems such as the UI programming and<br />
        the player controller. I also worked on the networking for the game and the<br />
        AI programming.
