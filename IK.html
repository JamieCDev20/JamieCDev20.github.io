        I started an Inverse Kinematics (IK) project over the summer in my free time. <br />
        I was just experimenting to see what I could come up with using an algorithm called<br />
        Cyclic Coordinate Descent (CCD).
        <br />
        <br />
        CCD loops through the IK chains (limbs) from tip to root and rotates each joint to move the tip<br />
        closer to the target.
        <br />
        <br />
        I got this working with Unity's transforms and eventually using a 3D spider model made by<br />

        The above and below gifs show the spider walking around a small demo scene.<br />
        As well as my first attempt at getting the legs to respect terrain like<br />
        slopes and steps.

        After dropping this project for a while, I restarted it with more research going<br />
        into the project at first. I settled on an algorithm called <br />
        Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics (FABRIK).<br />
        <br />
        Using the papers and videos made available by the creator, found
        <a href="http://andreasaristidou.com/FABRIK.html" style="color: green">here</a>,
        I was<br />
        able to form my own implementation of the algorithm.
        <br /><br />
        FABRIK works by looping through the limb twice, once from tip to root:<br />
        rotating each joint to point towards it's target, moving it to it's target<br />
        and then setting it'self as the next joint's target.<br />
        Then a second time from root to tip:<br />
        Translating each joint back towards the root so that the limb is where it started.

        Using a 3D Orc model made by another friend and colleague
        <a href="https://twitter.com/s0urearth" style="color:green">Louise Crouch</a>.
        <br />
        I was able to create a walk cycle where all of the motion is  generated<br />
        by mathematics.
